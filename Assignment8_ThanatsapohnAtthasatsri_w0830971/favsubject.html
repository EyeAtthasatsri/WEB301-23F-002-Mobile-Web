                        <h2>Most Favourite Subject</h2>

                        <p>Out of all the subjects I've learned, HTML is my favorite, especially since it was part of my first semester.
                        I really like HTML because it's cool and plays a big role in making websites. When I learned about HTML, 
                        it helped me understand the basic building blocks of the internet. It gave me the power to create and organize web
                        content in a precise way. it's a skill I can practice and use. Knowing how important HTML is in web development makes me excited
                        and I'm eager to learn even more about it in my future courses.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-4 bg-warning text-dark p-4">
                        
                        <h2>Secound subject is,</h2>
                        
                        <p>CSS, my second favorite subject studied in the second semester, adds an artistic touch to HTML's structural foundation.
                        It brings web pages to life, turning plain structures into visually appealing and dynamic experiences. With CSS, I can control
                        layout, colors, and styles, empowering me to create both functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. 
                        It's the creative side of web development where I infuse my personal touch, enhancing the user experience</p>

                        <h2>Third, </h2>
                        
                        <p>My current focus is on the Mobile Web, my third favorite subject this semester. Understanding how websites seamlessly 
                        adapt to various devices, particularly mobile phones, is crucial in our tech-centric world. Mobile Web teaches responsive design
                        principles, responsive aren't limited to desktop screens but dynamically adjust to different sizes. 
                        Learning about mobile-friendly layouts, touch interactions, and optimizing performance for diverse devices.</p>

                        <h2>Another Favourite</h2>

                        <p>Graphic design is another one of my favorite subjects, and I learned a lot from it in the first semester.
                        I worked on various projects that challenged me to use Photoshop and illustration tools effectively. I created
                        different types of designs, including logos, posters, flyers, and infographics, applying the principles and 
                        elements of graphic design. I also experimented with different styles, colors, fonts, and images to express 
                        my creativity and communicate my ideas.</p>

                        <h2>Final favorite subject</h2>

                        <p>Last semester, I enjoyed studying Web Usability, my favorite class. It's all about making websites
                        and apps that people find easy to use. I learned to focus on what users need and create designs that
                        not only look good but are also simple to navigate. We did projects where we made wireframes, like blueprints
                        for websites. This helped me learn how to plan where things go on a website to make it user-friendly. This class 
                        gave me important skills to make digital stuff easy to use and accessible, highlighting how make users happy
                        in the design process.</p>
